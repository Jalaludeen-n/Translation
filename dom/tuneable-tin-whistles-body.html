These whistles feature tuning slides to allow you to adjust the pitch, meaning you’ll always be in tune with your fellow musicians.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'PT Serif';" data-fontfamily="PT Serif">We have tunable models from some giants in the tin whistle world like Tony Dixon. Plus our best-selling Wild Whistles are also all tuneable models for extra versatility as well. Made from brass, these penny whistle models give a brighter and more responsive tone compared to the aluminium (used in most Irish whistles these days). Their delrin cork helps to create a strong and clear tone, and are available in D, C, A, B flat, and E flat.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'PT Serif';" data-fontfamily="PT Serif">These types of whistles are truly a game changer as most tin whistles are fixed in their pitch and aren’t nearly as versatile as a tuneable whistle. A tuneable whistle will allow you to join in confidently at any session without worrying about disrupting the music with off-key playing. This allows you to counteract any change in pitch due to the temperature or humidity of where you’re playing.</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'PT Serif';" data-fontfamily="PT Serif"><strong>Curious to find out more about the tin whistle and other penny whistle models?
