However over time the bouzouki made its way to Ireland and into the Irish music scene through musicians such as Dónal Lunny and Andy Irvine and the design was subsequently changed to suit the style of music. Nowadays, the modern Irish bouzouki is a longer scale handmade version of its Greek counterpart, has a tear-drop shaped body with a flat back, and is an eight string bouzouki, with each of the strings tuned in pairs.</span></p> <h3 class="classyunicodedone" style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Octave Mandolins and Other Accessories</span></strong></h3> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">As well as having top quality bouzoukis for sale, we also have some handmade octave mandolin models as well as bouzouki instrument cases, bouzouki stands, tuners, instructional books, and even more bouzouki and musical accessories for all working Irish bouzouki players.</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Looking for more information on Irish bouzoukis before you buy?
