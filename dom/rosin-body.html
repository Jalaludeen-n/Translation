However, the key ingredient in this relationship is one simple material, <em>rosin</em>. That’s why at<strong> McNeela Instruments</strong>, we consider ourselves lucky to have a number of top grade violin rosins at an affordable price range to make sure your violin and fiddle playing is as smooth and effortless as possible.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Rosin, or natural rosin, is a solid glossy substance made from tree resin and is applied to the violin bow to create friction between the bow’s horsehair and the strings. This causes the violin strings to vibrate against the bow and produce sound. Amongst all of our violin accessories, rosin is certainly one of the most important. This is because without rosin, the strings will struggle to produce any sort of strong sound or note against the bow and will sound all wispy instead. Plus, rosins are typically categroized as dark and light rosin, and are used in different climates during different seasons.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">We offer top notch rosins from the likes of Hidersine, a renowned British company known for their rosin, as well as the famous Italian Bogaro &amp; Clemente, and more!</span><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Whether you’re a first time beginner violin player, an intermediate player looking to evolve, or even an </span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">advanced </span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">fiddle playing veteran, we’re sure to have a rosin to your liking!</span></span></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Curious to know more about violin bows</strong></span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>, rosins, and other accessories?
