Our collection spans from our very own signature flutes to wooden flutes made by well-known manufacturers such as <strong>Arie de Keyzer</strong>, <strong>Des Seery</strong>, <strong>Martin Doyle</strong>, and <strong>Sam Murray</strong>.</p> <p>These particular Celtic wood flutes are available in a variety of excellent tonewoods such as <strong>Rosewood</strong>, <strong>Cocuswood</strong>, and <strong>African Blackwood</strong>. African Blackwood tends to be the favored wood among Irish flute makers as it provides a beautifully resonant tone while being rich in character and strong in volume.</p> <p>What makes these flutes unique as musical instruments is the variations in their design. Some are semi-keyed flutes, while others are diatonic simple open-holed flutes (limiting the flute to playing in a major or minor key). Additionally, some models are either 4-key or 6-key. As a result, each of these flute designs has its own merits and drawbacks, ultimately coming down to player preference and the genre they play.</p> <p>Our flute range spans from models suitable for beginners and first-time players to the most seasoned flute veterans and professional players, while still being as affordable as possible. All of our flutes are premium wood instruments and will surely be a valuable asset in your flute-playing arsenal.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Be sure to check out our expert flute blog for more info!</strong></p> <div style="text-align: center; background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 0.5em;"> <p style="text-decoration: underline; color: #169179;"><a href="https://blog.mcneelamusic.com/2015/09/14/how-to-play-the-irish-flute/" style="color: #169179; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Need any Tips for Playing the Irish Wooden Flute?</strong></a></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
