That’s why at<strong> McNeela Instruments</strong>, we take pride in having both high quality acoustic-electric mandolin models, as well as fully acoustic beginner mandolins for all player levels, especially beginners. That way you can be sure you have a quality instrument to learn on and enjoy the process.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Here at <strong>McNeela</strong>, we offer our own brand A-style and F-style mandolins. The A-style mandolin has an oval hole centre and a teardrop shaped body. They tend to have a warmer tone and are used in various mandolin folk styles of music. F-style models on the other hand are characterised by their swirly features on the body and sharper attack in their tone which makes them very well suited for bluegrass music. It should be noted that the F-style mandolins are usually a little pricier than an A-style mandolin, purely because of the extra aesthetic features. That being said, the higher quality the mandolin is, the more they tend to sound alike, so most people choose a mandolin based on personal preferences.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">To further get a hold on the basics of the mandolin, we offer a number of instructional books and accessories (suitable for both A-style and F-style mandolins) to help get you started as soon as possible. Our Absolute Beginners Mandolin Book is a great choice to guide you through the foundations of playing the instrument from scratch. In addition, we have some instrument cases and instrument stands as well to protect your mandolin from the common blemishes it can pick up along the way.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">We even have other instruments within the mandolin family such as octave mandolins and bouzoukis for those adventurous musicians looking for something different than your typical A-style or F-style mandolin.</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Need any more information on which mandolin is for you?
