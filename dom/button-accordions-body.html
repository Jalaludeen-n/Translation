The most commonly played model is a 21 or 23 button box, with a two row layout fingerboard on one side and 8 bass buttons on the opposite side. Each row of buttons on the&nbsp;melody keyboard produces the notes of a single diatonic scale.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">The bass buttons on the bass keyboard are arranged in pairs. One button of each pair will sounding the root note of a chord, while the corresponding button will play a full major triad.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">The Irish button accordion is frequently referred to as a&nbsp;two row&nbsp;diatonic accordion, though it's actually a fully chromatic instrument. The term chromatic accordion usually refers however to the button accordions used to play other genres of music such as classical or jazz.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">You’ll also occasionally see the Irish button accordion referred to as a&nbsp;two row melodeon. This is not to be confused with the&nbsp;<a href="/concertinas/accordions/the-new-mcneela-wooden-melodeon/">one row, ten button melodeon</a>&nbsp;which also commonly features in traditional Irish music.</span><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;"><strong><a href="https://blog.mcneelamusic.com/2020/09/03/which-accordion-key-is-better-for-traditional-irish-music-b-c-or-c-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Accordion Key Is Better For Traditional Irish Music: B/C or C#/D?</a></strong></span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">Irish button accordions are typically tuned to B/C or C#/D.&nbsp;This simply means that the outer row of buttons is in the key of B, while the inner row is in C, or the outer row of buttons is in the key of D, with its corresponding inner row in the key of C#.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">This configuration makes all the notes of the chromatic scale available.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">The more popular tuning for Irish button accordions is usually B/C.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">C#/D tuning has seen a resurgence in popularity in more recent times however. Both systems are now in widespread use, though the C♯/D push and draw accordion system is still somewhat less common.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">What’s the difference?&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">The quick and simplified answer is that on a traditional&nbsp;B/C Irish button accordion&nbsp;you’ll move your fingers more, but the bellows less. On a C#/D accordion you’ll move your fingers less, but the bellows more.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">As you can see from the selection below, we cater for every level of accordion player, from <a href="/beginner-accordions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beginner</a> to <a href="/paolo-soprani-accordions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advanced</a>.&nbsp;We stock only the best button accordions, including Paolo Soprani accordions, and produce our very own best sellers -&nbsp;the<strong> <a href="/accordions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McNeela Button Accordion Range</a></strong>.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;"><span class="s1"><span class="s1">If you're unsure which Irish button accordion is for you, check our handy guide:&nbsp;</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://blog.mcneelamusic.com/2020/09/17/the-beginner-irish-accordion-buyers-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Irish Accordion – A Complete Buyer’s Guide</a>.</strong></span></span></p> <p class="p1 first_p"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;"><strong>SHIPPING:</strong>&nbsp;We ship all over the world, but if you live in Dublin why not come and test one of our best selling accordions for yourself?
