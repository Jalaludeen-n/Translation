That’s why at <strong>McNeela Instruments</strong>, we stock only the best violin strings and to ensure that your violin sings every note from the moment it’s first played. As a string instrument, it is vital that the violin has a string set that matches the standard of the tonewoods and bows to really make the instrument come to life.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Typically, there are three different types of strings you can choose from:</span></p> <ul> <li> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Gut Core Strings</strong>: the traditional violin strings made from sheep intestine and wound with copper or silver. Gut strings are the warmest sounding strings as they are made from organic material, but are also the most susceptible to external factors like humidity and changes in temperature.</span></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Steel Core Strings:</strong> Unlike gut strings, steel core strings are more stable and resistant to the external factors that plague gut strings and tend to sound brighter than their organic counterparts. Overall, steel core strings may not be as versatile sounding as the gut core strings, but are definitely sturdier.&nbsp;</span></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Synthetic Core Strings:</strong> The black sheep of the family, synthetic core strings are the newest addition to the violin string family. Being a more affordable option than the organic gut strings, and being more resistant as well, these synthetic strings are quickly gaining popularity amongst many different violin players and especially beginners.</span></p> </li> </ul> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Which one of these strings is best? Well that’s a matter of personal preference. However, certain factors such as whatever genre of music violin or viola players may pick could influence what strings you put on your violin or fiddle. If you want to play folk styles of music or classical, you may be suggested to use the original gut core strings as they have a more mellow sound. Alternatively, if you are a jazz or bluegrass fiddle player, then steel core strings might be more appropriate for you! It's all a matter of what kind of sound you’re looking to achieve.</span> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>If you’re looking for more info regarding what violin strings to use?
