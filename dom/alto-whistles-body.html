Alto whistles tend to sit in between the soprano and low whistle range. This in turn makes them a unique yet versatile instrument.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'PT Serif';">That’s why at McNeela Music, we have a number of alto whistles available! These whistle models come from some of the most well-known brands in the Irish music circle. Some of which being <strong>Generation and Tony Dixon</strong>. Plus, we also have our own McNeela Wild Whistle Series as well! Our collection includes tuneable and polymer whistles to give you an instrument that sounds great and stands the test of time.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'PT Serif';">We have whistles suitable for every level. So whether you’re a complete newbie to Irish music, or already a seasoned tin whistle pro, we’re sure to have something for you.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'PT Serif';">Our <strong>Wild Whistles</strong> are our most popular set due to their high-quality build and smoothness. Made from brass, these whistles have quite a bright tone when compared to aluminum ones (which are very common today). Plus, they have a <strong>delrin cork </strong>that creates a really strong and clear tone. All of these features make these a perfect range for standing out in any pub session!</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'PT Serif';">Curious to know more about the alto whistle?
