This contrasts concert or boehm keyed flutes as they tend to be chromatic instruments capable of playing in multiple keys. However, there is certainly a charm to the ancient design of the Irish flute that’s hard to match.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Don’t let the simple design fool you though. A keyless wooden flute is still a powerful and versatile instrument to play and our wide selection of keyless flutes houses some of our best-sellers such as the <strong><a href="/wind/the-cygnet-irish-rosewood-flute-offer-inside/">Cygnet Flute</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="/wind/lon-dubh-polymer-irish-flute/">The Lon Dubh</a></strong>. Each of these keyless models are premium instruments that fit in a very budget-friendly price range, which is perfect for beginner players.</span></p> <h2><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>What Are Our Flutes Made From?</strong></span></h2> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Our keyless flutes are made from a wide range of wood materials, such as African blackwood, rosewood, cocuswood, and even delrin (a lightweight yet robust polymer that works excellently for a flute resilient to humidity and temperature changes).&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Looking for more information?
