Our own flute cases are a must have for any serious Irish flute player, as they will make the question of storage much easier without having to worry about long term exposure to the arch nemeses of all Irish flutes - temperature and humidity!</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">We offer a mix from our very own brand flute hard case series, as well as carrying bag - like models from <strong>Tradpro </strong>and <strong>Setanta</strong>. Our cases and flute bag models are made from either a durable injection resin, hardwood, or an ultra strong coated canvas. Each of these flute bags and cases are foam lined in their exterior, making them shock absorbent for added protection. Plus, some models even have extra pockets for flute accessories, or a handle or an adjustable shoulder strap for ease of transport and carry.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Our flute carrying bags and cases are geared towards Irish open-hole flute design without keys, as we specialise in traditional Irish flutes. So it should be noted though that some of these boxes and cases are designed with a particular range of lightweight flute in mind (i.e. soprano, or low flute), so <strong>make sure to check what type of flute is suitable for each case in the product description</strong>. </span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Looking for more info on Irish flutes?
