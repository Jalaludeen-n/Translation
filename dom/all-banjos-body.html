Here, we have banjos that cater towards all playing levels, from first time beginner and student banjos, all the way up to expert and professional grade banjos, we have them all. Despite our speciality being in traditional Irish folk instruments, we offer banjos capable of playing in multiple music genres such as jazz, country-western, bluegrass and more. Plus, our banjos are not only top-quality instruments, but are also available at an affordable price!</p> <p dir="ltr">Our expansive range contains both 4 string tenor banjos and classic 5 string banjo models. All of our fretted banjos come in 17 fret, 19 fret, and even 22 fret models as well for maximum variety. Each of these are constructed from top quality tonewoods, and all feature a resonator banjo backed design. Amongst these choices are our best sellers - <a href="/string-instruments/the-celt-banjo-19-fret/">The Celt Tenor Banjo</a> series, and the <a href="/string-instruments/mcneela-premium-5-string-banjo/">McNeela Premium 5 String Banjo</a>.</p> <p dir="ltr">We also feature some excellent banjos from incredibly well known brands such as Bacon &amp; Day, Framus, Gretsch, Rettburg &amp; Lange banjos, and more. Some of these particular banjos come from our vintage banjo selection, as we refurbish and sell vintage and second hand banjos. Although we offer other specific vintage products, our vintage banjos are particularly unique in our fretted instrument collection.</p> <p dir="ltr">Do you have a second hand banjo in great condition? Be sure to contact us as we may be interested!</p> <p dir="ltr">Beyond banjos, we also house a number of accessories such as string sets, picks, instructional books, CD’s, tuners, gig bags and a plethora of others. These accessories can help you create your own beginners pack and can help level up your setup and banjo playing experience.</p> <p dir="ltr">In addition, we can also set up our banjos in a left-handed configuration if you’d like - just leave a note when you place an order on our website.</p> <p dir="ltr">Looking for more information on banjos?
