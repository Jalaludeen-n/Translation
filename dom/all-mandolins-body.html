Here at <strong>McNeela Instruments</strong>, we’ve found a solution to this problem by offering a wide mix of mandolins. Each of these instruments stand out for their eye-catching designs and unparalleled timbres. Whether you’re a first-time learner or a seasoned mandolinist already, we’re confident that our collection has something for you.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Our selection offers both Florentine-style (F-style) mandolins and classic A-style mandolins. Each of these mandolins offers a unique flare and incredible tones. The A-style models are characterized by their pear or teardrop shapes and are perfect for traditional Irish and folk music. They tend to cater to those who are looking for more rich and mellow tones.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">F-style mandolins are notoriously used in bluegrass, country, and folk-rock genres. They are most known for their decorative scrolls/swirls, and for producing a sharp and vibrant sound. This sharp percussive-like tone helps it stand out when played amongst other instruments giving it an edge in a group setting!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Although both of these designs have their own traits, it’s important to know that the higher the quality of the mandolin is, the fewer differences there are in the sound of each type (F-style and A-style). Plus, the truth is that it usually comes down to subjectivity at the end of the day when it comes to choosing a type of mandolin.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">No matter which type of mandolin you pick, you can be confident that it will elevate your music from the very first note. At McNeela Instruments, we are committed to providing only the finest traditional Irish mandolins and accessories.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Still wondering what kind of mandolin works best for you?
