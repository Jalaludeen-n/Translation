Our carbon fibre bows in particular have proven to be a very effective substitute for the more traditional tonewoods used in violin bows, as they are more resilient to the test of time, and resistant to temperature and humidity. These bows coupled with our own specially crafted violin chinrest models and fittings, sure to make your playing experience more comfortable.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">In addition, we also offer a selection of A grade violin rosins by renowned brands such as Hidersine and Bogaro &amp; Clemente to ensure your bows movements are incredibly smooth on the strings, and are always up to standard. If you’re looking to elevate your knowledge and skills, look no further as we also have a wide range of instructional books for violins and other instruments.
